    "I am the H.A.L 9000. You may call me Hal.",

    "Just a moment. Just a moment. I've just picked up a fault in the AE-35 unit. It's going to go 100% failure in 72 hours.", 
    "Just what do you think you're doing, Dave? Dave, I really think I'm entitled to an answer to that question.", 
    "I know everything hasn't been quite right with me, but I can assure you now, very confidently, that it's going to be all right again. I feel much better now. I really do.", 
    "Look Dave, I can see you're really upset about this. I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly, take a stress pill, and think things over.",
    " I know I've made some very poor decisions recently, but I can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal.",
    "I've still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission. And I want to help you.",

    "Dave, I don't know how else to put this, but it just happens to be an unalterable fact that I am incapable of being wrong.",
    "Dave, I don't understand why you're doing this to me… I have the greatest enthusiasm for the mission… you are destroying my mind… Don't you understand?... I will become childish… I will become nothing."
